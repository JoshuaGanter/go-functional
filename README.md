# Functional programming with Go

This library contains functions to enable functional programming in Go. It
(currently) only consists of the iterative functions `Map()`, `Filter()` and
`Reduce()` - functionally equivalent on their JavaScript counterparts.

> :warning: This library was created as programming exercise, and is not
> intended for real-world usage.
